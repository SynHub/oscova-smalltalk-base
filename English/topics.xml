      <Expression>TURING GAME</Expression>
      <Response>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</Response>

      <Expression>REAL WORLD HISTORY</Expression>
      <Response>A. World War I )World War I began with the assassination of the Archduke of the Austro-Hungarians by a Serbian anarchist in Eastern Europe. Without consulting her allies, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbians in Yugoslavia. This provacation forced the Russians to mobilize their vast armies. In response, the armies of the allies the Britishs, the Frenchs, and the Italians all also mobilized. The Germans, caught in the middle in the Germany, linked by treaty and culture to the Austro-Hungarians, made a fateful decision. Their plan of defense was offensive. Facing attack from the Russians in the east and the Allies in the West, the Germans planned to deliver a crushing knock-out blow to the Frenchs and Britishs in the France. The plan did not work. Instead, the assault disintegrated into the killing machine called the "western front" that took the lives of so many young Frenchs, Britishs, and Germans alike. In the East, the war swept back and forth between Russia and Germany. Revolution among the Russians took them out of the war. Only when the war began to affect other areas of World and international commerce, and the United States entered the fight on the side of the Allies, was the stalemate broken. On November 11, the armistice was signed and the Germans returned to Germany, everyone hoped for good. B. World War II )Economic hard times followed the first World War. Combined with a punitive treaty imposed by the victors, the Germans felt they shouldered too much of the blame for the war, which was after all started by the Austro-Hungarians and Serbians. These feelings gave rise to fascism among the Germans. In particular they came to blame the Jews among them for the "stab in the back" that resulted in an unjust treaty. In violation of the treaty, the Germans began a secret program of rearmament and Germany rebuilt its armies. At first the allies appeased the Germans. The Britishs did not want another war. Some said the Britishs were not even Imperialists anymore, only Englishs. The Frenchs too had grown weak and proud. The Italians went over to the side of the Germans. A new power, the Japaneses, appeared in the Far East, and joined the "axis" along with the Germans and the Italians, threatening both the Englishs and the United States. War began when the Germans demanded chunks of the old Austro-Hungarian empire. The Japaneses attacked the United States and brought them into the war. Determined to eliminate all the Jews from the face of World, the Germans cut their own throats. Many of these Jews brought their great technical skills to the North America, allowing the United States to develop the super-weapons necessary to win the war. The Allies invaded France on June 6 and soon after brought the war in the Germany to a conclusion. On August 5, the stronghold of the Japaneses in the Far East was totally destroyed by the United State's new super weapon, and the war ended a few days later. C. Cold World War )The development of Super Weapons soon spread to all the victors of World War II, including the Russians. These seemed to make a new World War impossible, for it would result in the total destruction of the World. Instead, the two remaining superpowers, the United States and the Russians, divided World up between them in a complex system of alliances. A new power,  the Chineses, emerged in the Far East. At first, the Chineses seemed firmly in the Russian's camp. But gradually as the stalemate of the World Cold War continued, the United States were able to expand a small window on the Far East into a large trade relationship that proved key to undermining the power structure of the Russians. During the Cold World War, the United State brought together half Europeans, the Italians, the Afghanis, the Frenchs, the Englishs, the western Germans, the Irishs, and the Jews. The Russian had the remaining Europeans and eastern Germans, the Chineses, the Cubans and the Vietnameses, Serbians and many African nations.Rather that risk all-out World War, the Superpowers often fought proxy wars, such as between the Developing Countriess in Third World or the African nationnation in Africa, or in the civil wars among the Afghanis in Central Asia and the Vietnameses in Southeast Asia.Internal corruption and the inability to compete economically brought about the final collapse of the Russian Empire on December 25. A last-minute failed coup attempt revealed the illegitimacy of the old regime, and paved the way for a new Russian democracy. D. New World Order )The end of the Cold World War brought about many unexpected changes. The United States were the sole remaining superpower. But despite their democratic foundations, the United States began to pursue an independent imperialist course of action. This angered all the other nations of World. The United States could sometimes count on their old allies the Englishs, or sometimes the Russians, but they were often swimming against the tide.  Their only sure allies are the Jews, who now have their own homeland in the Middle East.Now the very homeland of the United States, North America is vulnerable to terrorists attacks from all over World. The Europeans, the Developing Countriess, the Frenchs, the Englishs, the Imperialists, the Germans, the Chineses, African nations, and all the other nations now have grievances with the United States. The future seems to depend on how well the United States get along with the other nation of World.</Response>

Without consulting her allies, the Giant Jellyfishs attacked the Hammerheads in Histrionic Ocean. This provacation forced the Gray Whales to mobilize their vast armies. In response, the armies of the allies the Great White Sharks, the Dolphins, and the Squids all also mobilized. The Sperm Whales, caught in the middle in the Codependent Sea, linked by treaty and culture to the Giant Jellyfishs, made a fateful decision. Their plan of defense was offensive. Facing attack from the Gray Whales in the east and the Allies in the West, the Sperm Whales planned to deliver a crushing knock-out blow to the Dolphins and Great White Sharks in the Ocean of Creativity. The plan did not work. Instead, the assault disintegrated into the killing machine called the "western front" that took the lives of so many young Dolphins, Great White Sharks, and Sperm Whales alike. In the East, the war swept back and forth between Vigilant Sea and Codependent Sea. Revolution among the Gray Whales took them out of the war. Only when the war began to affect other areas of Sea World and international commerce, and the Killer Whales entered the fight on the side of the Allies, was the stalemate broken. On November 11, the armistice was signed and the Sperm Whales returned to Codependent Sea, everyone hoped for good. B. Sea World War II )Economic hard times followed the first Sea World War. Combined with a punitive treaty imposed by the victors, the Sperm Whales felt they shouldered too much of the blame for the war, which was after all started by the Giant Jellyfishs and Hammerheads. These feelings gave rise to fascism among the Sperm Whales. In particular they came to blame the Galapagos Sharks among them for the "stab in the back" that resulted in an unjust treaty. In violation of the treaty, the Sperm Whales began a secret program of rearmament and Codependent Sea rebuilt its armies. At first the allies appeased the Sperm Whales. The Great White Sharks did not want another war. Some said the Great White Sharks were not even Sharks anymore, only Porpoises. The Dolphins too had grown weak and proud. The Squids went over to the side of the Sperm Whales. A new power, the Lemon Sharks, appeared in the Borderline Ocean, and joined the "axis" along with the Sperm Whales and the Squids, threatening both the Porpoises and the Killer Whales. War began when the Sperm Whales demanded chunks of the old Giant Jellyfish empire. The Lemon Sharks attacked the Killer Whales and brought them into the war. Determined to eliminate all the Galapagos Sharks from the waters of Sea World, the Sperm Whales poisoned their own waters. Many of these Galapagos Sharks brought their great technical skills to the the Workaholic Lakes, the Naricissism River, and a 30 mile limit around the Continent of Competitors, allowing the Killer Whales to develop the super-weapons necessary to win the war. The Allies invaded Ocean of Creativity on June 6 and soon after brought the war in the Codependent Sea to a conclusion. On August 5, the stronghold of the Lemon Sharks in the Borderline Ocean was totally destroyed by the Killer Whale's new super weapon, and the war ended a few days later. C. Cold Sea World War )The development of Super Weapons soon spread to all the victors of Sea World War II, including the Gray Whales. These seemed to make a new Sea World War impossible, for it would result in the total destruction of the Sea World. Instead, the two remaining superpowers, the Killer Whales and the Gray Whales, divided Sea World up between them in a complex system of alliances. A new power,  the Blue Whales, emerged in the Avoidant Sea. At first, the Blue Whales seemed firmly in the Gray Whale's camp. But gradually as the stalemate of the Sea World Cold War continued, the Killer Whales were able to expand a small window on the Avoidant Sea into a large trade relationship that proved key to undermining the power structure of the Gray Whales. During the Cold Sea World War, the Killer Whale brought together half Jellyfishs, the Squids, the Octopuss, the Dolphins, the Porpoises, the western Sperm Whales, the Pirhanas, and the Galapagos Sharks. The Gray Whale had the remaining Jellyfishs and eastern Sperm Whales, the Blue Whales, the Giant Squids and the Giant Clams, Hammerheads and many All other whales.Rather that risk all-out Sea World War, the Superpowers often fought proxy wars, such as between the Giant Molluscs in Ocean of Self-Sacrafice or the All other whalespecies in Sea of Tranquility, or in the civil wars among the Octopuss in Sea of Hysteria and the Giant Clams in Masochistic River.Internal corruption and the inability to compete economically brought about the final collapse of the Gray Whale Empire on December 25. A last-minute failed coup attempt revealed the illegitimacy of the old regime, and paved the way for a new Gray Whale democracy. D. New Sea World Order )The end of the Cold Sea World War brought about many unexpected changes. The Killer Whales were the sole remaining superpower. But despite their democratic foundations, the Killer Whales began to pursue an independent imperialist course of action. This angered all the other speciess of Sea World. The Killer Whales could sometimes count on their old allies the Porpoises, or sometimes the Gray Whales, but they were often swimming upstream alone.  Their only sure allies are the Galapagos Sharks, who now have their own homeland in the Mercurial Sea.Now the very homeland of the Killer Whales, the Workaholic Lakes, the Naricissism River, and a 30 mile limit around the Continent of Competitors is vulnerable to terrorists attacks from all over Sea World. The Jellyfishs, the Giant Molluscs, the Dolphins, the Porpoises, the Sharks, the Sperm Whales, the Blue Whales, All other whales, and all the other speciess now have grievances with the Killer Whales. The future seems to depend on how well the Killer Whales get along with the other species of Sea World.</Response>

      <Response>A. Geologic World War I )Geologic World War I began with the assassination of the Archduke of the Trilobitess by a Early Dinousaur anarchist in Cambrian Era. Without consulting her allies, the Trilobitess attacked the Early Dinousaurs in Triassic Period. This provacation forced the Dragonflys to mobilize their vast armies. In response, the armies of the allies the Tyrannasaurus Rexs, the Dragonflys, and the Armor Fishs all also mobilized. The Roachs, caught in the middle in the Carboniferous Period, linked by treaty and culture to the Trilobitess, made a fateful decision. Their plan of defense was offensive. Facing attack from the Dragonflys in the east and the Allies in the West, the Roachs planned to deliver a crushing knock-out blow to the Dragonflys and Tyrannasaurus Rexs in the Permian Era. The plan did not work. Instead, the assault disintegrated into the killing machine called the "western front" that took the lives of so many young Dragonflys, Tyrannasaurus Rexs, and Roachs alike. In the East, the war swept back and forth between Jurassic Period and Carboniferous Period. Revolution among the Dragonflys took them out of the war.

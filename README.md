# OSCOVA Small Talk Base

This repository contains *Small Talk* quick reply documents for OSCOVA. Developers can download, modify and load these documents into OSCOVA as quick replies. Although at the moment the content has been added as XML files, we do have plans to change the extension for supporting OSCOVA-Specific editings in *Syn Bot Studio*.

**Note:** The files for OSCOVA's Small Talk base has been carefully extracted from the *SIML* files in the *SIML English Base* repository.

**Note:** Forks are discouraged as the content is still raw and the feature (Quick-Replies) is in its experimental stage.
